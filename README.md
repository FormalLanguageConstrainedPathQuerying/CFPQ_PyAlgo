# CFPQ_PyAlgo
The CFPQ_PyAlgo is a repository for developing, testing and benchmarking algorithms that solve Formal-Language-Constrained Path Problems, such as Context-Free Path Queries and Regular Path Queries. All algorithms are based on the [GraphBLAS](http://graphblas.org/index.php?title=Graph_BLAS_Forum) framework that allows you to represent graphs as matrices and work with them in terms of linear algebra. For convenience, all the code is written in Python using [pygraphblas](https://github.com/michelp/pygraphblas) or in C/C++ using purely [SuiteSparse](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse) with a Python wrapper. 

# Installation
First of all you need to clone repository with its submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/simpletonDL/CFPQ_PyAlgo.git 
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
Then the easiest way to get started is to use Docker. An alternative, which is more correct, is to install everything directly.

## Using Docker
The first way to start is to use Docker:

```bash
# build docker image
docker build --tag <some_tag> .

# run docker container
docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/CFPQ_PyAlgo <some_tag> bash
```
After it you can develop everything locally and run tests and benchmarks inside the container. Also you can use PyCharm and [configure an interpreter using Docker]( https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-docker-as-a-remote-interpreter.html).

## Direct install
The correct way is to install everything into your local python interpreter or virtual environment.

First of all you need to install [pygraphblas](https://github.com/michelp/pygraphblas) package.
```bash
pip3 install pygraphblas
```
Secondly you need to install cfpq_data_devtools package and other requirements:

```bash
cd deps/CFPQ_Data
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py install --user

cd ../../
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
To check if the installation was successful you can run simple tests
```bash
python3 -m pytest test -v -m "CI"
```
# Benchmark
Look please [Readme](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/CFPQ_PyAlgo/blob/master/benchmark/README.md) in *benchmark*

#Usage

Let's describe an example of using the implementation outside this environment.

For example, you want to solve a basic problem CFPQ using the matrix algorithm. To do this, you need a grammar (**Gr**) in the CNF (you can get using the tools from *deps/CFPQ_Data*), as well as a graph (**G**) in the format of "triplets". 

The file containing the grammar **G** representation must be named *.cnf (for algorithms using RSA *.automat). The file containing the graph representation, the name must be *.txt.

Then the matrix algorithm can be run as follows, where *PATH_TO_GRAMMAR* --- path to file *.cnf, *PATH_TO_GRAPH* --- path to file *.txt
```cython
from src.problems.Base.algo.matrix_base.matrix_base import MatrixBaseAlgo

algo = MatrixBaseAlgo()
algo.prepare(PATH_TO_GRAPH, PATH_TO_GRAMMAR)
res = algo.solve()
print(res.matrix_S.nvals)
```
The given fragment displays the number of pairs of vertices between which the desired path exists.

More examples can be found in *test*
